## 🚀Project Overview

This Angular application was developed as a training project. It features token-based authentication (login), user management, a dynamic post feed with comments and replies, a search section for exploring published content, and a responsive interface built with standalone components and lazy-loaded routes for optimal performance.

The application is divided into the following sections:
- Login — the first page, which requires a token to access. You can generate one directly here.
- Home Page 
- Posts Page — allows users to comment, like, view existing comments, and edit posts.
- Proponents Page — shows a list of users with the ability to view their posts by clicking on their name, as well as create or delete users.
- Search Page — lets users search for available posts by typing keywords.
